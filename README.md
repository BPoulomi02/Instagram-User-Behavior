This repository contains a small analysis done on a Instagram user behavior and comments dataset. First the data has been cleaned and loaded by pandas library then head and tail of the data are viewed. After that some visualizations are done to understand the data better. Following a sentiment analysis model is built based on the comments of the users. The model can predict the comment as positive means "yes" and negative means "no". The model was built using scikit learn library of python.
